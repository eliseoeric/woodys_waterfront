Custom theme build for WordPress for a client.
The theme is built on a small framework that handles back end tasks such as action and filter management, custom post types, a custom admin menu and the Open Weather widget.
The bulk of the backend code is located in the `framework` directory. The theme was built with on `_s` boiler plate, with regards to the template part structure and so forth.
The theme's framework also make's use of WordPress's pub sub model and filters the layout of a few third party plugins intended to be used on the site (WooCommerce & GravityForms).
